I plan on directing the player around my level through a series of lights and triggers. When they first enter the level, the only light sources will be from the window on the far side of the room, and a lamp illuminating the keyboard on the desk. The bloom effect in global illumination will accentuate both of these. When they reach the desk, they will enter a trigger that will turn on the tv, guiding them over there. When they reach the tv, another trigger will turn on a light in the kitchen area. When they reach that, they will enter a final trigger that will turn on a light in the back corridor, leading the player to the end of the level.
